# Instructions for Running my Project

This Program is works just like filling out a Madlib in real life. No need to upload any directories. Just go ahead and open the madlibs.py file and run the program. You first need to select the genre (1-4) and then you need to fill in your own words as the program prompts you for certain wordtypes. After you have filled in all the necessary words, the program will tell you the story you helped write.
